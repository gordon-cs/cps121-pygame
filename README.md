# cps121-pygame

Thin interface layer providing simplified routines for 
displaying and modifying images using [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org).

Run file directly to see a demo.  You will need to have
PyGame installed in your Python to use this.

To create `pydoc` documentation, run `make` to create
html and text.  (You will need to change to your version of
`pydoc`, probably just `pydoc3`.)
